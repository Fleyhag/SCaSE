3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermodynamic simulations
Scheil solidification curves are reported in Fig. 1a. In 18Ni300, the solidification starts with the formation of austenite (FCC_A1) and with the increase in mass fraction of the solid, the remaining liquid to solidify progressively enriches in alloying elements. The solidification ends with the formation of TiC (FCC_A1#2). It is interesting to note that for the Co–Ti free alloy, the primary phase is the ferrite (BCC_A2) followed by austenite (FCC_A1) as the volume fraction of the solid increases, and finally Mo rich carbides (M6C) are formed. Another noticeable difference is the very small Scheil solidification temperature range for the Co–Ti free alloy as a result of its leaner composition. Applying the thermodynamic based martensite start (Ms) modeling by Thermo-Calc, the Ms in 18Ni300 and the Co–Ti free alloy, using the nominal chemical compositions, were ∼215 °C and ∼200 °C, respectively. In both case at about room temperature, over 95% of the austenite transforms to martensite (Fig. 1b). The need to reduce Ni in the absence of Co to keep the martensitic transformation temperatures sufficiently high is also illustrated by comparing the temperatures of 18Ni300 composition without Co. The equilibrium step diagrams also point out the stability of delta ferrite at high temperature for the Co–Ti free material compared with that of 18Ni300 showing no delta ferrite at high temperature (Fig. 1c and d). Ferrite and austenite stability, and equilibrium volume fractions at lower temperatures are similar for both alloys. Within the ageing temperature interval (e.g., 400–600 °C), two main intermetallic phases are present in 18Ni300, namely Ni3Ti, and Laves. It is well known that, even if laves (Fe2Mo) is an equilibrium phase at those temperatures, given a sufficient cooling rate from the solution annealing temperature, ageing of the quenched or air-cooled martensite results in the precipitation of nano sized metastable Ni3Mo instead of that of equilibrium laves. Longer times or high temperatures are needed for the Ni3Mo to transform to the equilibrium laves phase [30]. In the Co free alloy, the only major strengthening phase is Ni3Mo (or laves as shown in equilibrium diagram), as a result of the absence of Ti. Due to the increased wt.% of Mo in Co–Ti free alloy, the stability of laves phase is extended to slightly below 900 °C. The laves stability temperatures in 18Ni300 is ∼725 °C according to the equilibrium diagram.

3.2. Material characterization and mechanical testing
3.2.1. Microstructure and phases prior to ageing
Fig. 2a and b shows LOM images of the 18Ni300 and Co–Ti free steel in the as built condition, respectively. The 18Ni300 and Co–Ti free alloy present similar microstructural features (i.e., martensitic microstructure). The presence of non-metallic inclusions in both microstructures are evident. In case of 18Ni300 the inclusions seem to be larger with higher vol% compared with the novel alloy. According to EDS analysis, these inclusions were preferentially Al- and Ti-rich oxides in 18Ni300. Non-metallic inclusions found in matrix of the Co–Ti free alloy were characterized as oxide phases containing mainly Si and Al. Due to the lower amount of Al and Ti in the novel alloy, it is reasonable that this steel possesses an enhanced cleanliness. The presence of these oxide inclusions was also detected in other additively manufactured maraging steels [13,24,31]. Inclusions average area fraction normalized by the total area are 0.4% and 0.12% for 18Ni300 and Co–Ti free alloy in as-built condition, respectively. These measurements were performed on three representative micrographs for each alloy.

Fig. 3 summarizes the XRD diffractograms acquired from samples in as built and solution annealed conditions. No differences were detected between the two different compositions of the alloy or between the as built and solution annealed conditions. Indeed, only two peaks associated with martensite (α) can be observed. No peaks associated to residual austenite (γ) were found, meaning that fraction of residual austenite is below the XRD detection limit (i.e., < 2–3 vol% using Cu K-alpha radiation source for steels [32]) in all the samples, in agreement with martensite fractions simulations in Fig. 1b. The as built microstructure comprises a martensitic matrix and a cellular solidification structure characterized by intercellular micro-segregation appearing brighter in back scatter electron (BSE) micrographs (Fig. 4a). The cell size is around 1 μm, while the intercellular micro-segregation has an average thickness of 120 ± 17 nm. According to the high magnification EBSD maps, 2.6 ± 0.8 vol% retained austenite was found at the intercellular micro-segregation in as built material (Fig. 4b, and the inset). It is very well elaborated and widely reported that the cellular structure in rapidly solidified PBF-LB processed alloys is a result of the constitutional undercooling accompanied by the micro-segregation of alloying elements at the intercellular/inter-dendritic regions, thus leading to a local drop in martensite start temperature [33,34]. This is also shown in supplementary file 1 using Scheil modeling coupled with diffusion calculator in Thermo-calc software where martensite start temperature drops to below 100 °C at the micro-segregated areas resulting in chemical stabilization of RA. This phenomenon is due to the gradual enrichment of alloying elements, especially Ni, Mo and C from the cell core to the cellular boundaries. In solution annealed condition, where the microstructure is homogenized and micro-segregation is removed by diffusion of alloying elements at high temperature (Fig. 4c), the microstructure is fully martensitic, and RA becomes barely detectable even by EBSD analysis (Fig. 4d). A full description of the microstructural features in 18Ni300 can be found in the previous work of the authors [13].

The very low vol% of RA provides a suitable condition for direct aging of the martensitic as built microstructure without the need for prior solution annealing. Moreover, an obvious peak broadening is evident for the AB Co–Ti free samples compared to that of solution annealed. This represents larger lattice defects density (e.g., dislocations) in the rapidly cooled laser melted as built material [35]. This difference seems to be less pronounced in 18Ni300 samples. This needs further investigation which is outside the scope of the present work.
3.2.2. DSC analysis, ageing kinetics
DSC analyses were used to conduct a comparison study of the aging behavior of the two alloys. DSC scans at a heating rate of 20 °C/min are reported in Fig. 5. Four characteristic peaks for 18Ni300 and Co–Ti free alloy can be identified. In both cases, the first exothermic peak (peak #1) represents the formation of Mo rich M2C carbides or coherent precipitation zones [[36], [37], [38]]. The second exothermic peak (peak #2) represents the formation of the main strengthening precipitates (Ni3(Mo, Ti)) phases followed by equilibrium Fe2Mo (laves) and Fe7Mo6 (μ phase) in case of long holdings at ageing temperature [37,39,40]. The endothermic peaks (peaks #3 and #4) respectively refer to austenite reversion by diffusion (i.e., local Ni enrichment due to precipitate dissolution or transformation of Ni3Mo to equilibrium Fe2Mo, or Fe7Mo6) and austenite transformation by shear, respectively [34,41,42].
{{Fig. 5. DSC curves of 18Ni300 and Co–Ti free alloy$figure#fig5 img@https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2238785424006173-gr5_lrg.jpg}}

It is reported that the more intense 2nd exothermic peak in 18Ni300 is related to the precipitation of metastable Ni3Mo and Ni3Ti in peak aged condition [37,40]. In the absence of Ti, the second exothermic peak in Co–Ti free alloy must be only related to the Mo rich precipitates (e.g., metastable Ni3Mo). This peak is not only characterized by a lower intensity compared with that of 18Ni300, but also is shifted towards higher temperatures, suggesting that the precipitation kinetics are different. Even if in the Co–Ti free alloy, the Mo content is almost twice that of 18Ni300, the precipitation kinetics in 18Ni300 is faster. It is suggested that Co lowers the solid solubility of Mo in Fe–Ni martensite. This leads to enhanced precipitation kinetics, more uniform and larger vol% of Mo containing intermetallic precipitates in Co containing maraging steels. Following the pioneering work of Sha [43], it was quantitatively shown that in aged cobalt free and cobalt containing 18Ni–5Mo-0.7Ti maraging system, the same families of Ti rich and Mo rich precipitates exist. However, the Mo rich phase only forms at a later stage of aging in the Co-free steel (i.e., longer times or higher ageing temperatures) and is characterized by lower vol% compared with that of Co containing system. In addition to this, Mo level in Ni3Ti precipitates is much lower in Co-free steel compared with Co-bearing counterpart. These quantitative evaluations clarified that a major role of cobalt in maraging steels is to lower the solubility of Mo in martensite, leading to an increased precipitation kinetics as well as volume percentage of Mo containing precipitates thus increasing the strength. The latter will be discussed shortly in section 3.2.3 where the ageing curves are shown.
Lastly, the delay in austenite reversion in Co–Ti free alloy is ascribed to its lower Ni content. This accounts for its enhanced softening resistance at elevated temperatures, which is promising in view of its application in tooling.
3.2.3. Hardness and aging curves
Hardness of the Co–Ti free alloy and 18Ni300 were measured both for as built and solution annealed conditions. The two alloys do not show significative differences in hardness values. In as built state, both alloys show a hardness of ∼370 HV1, while the hardness is decreased to ∼350 HV1 after solution annealing. It is well known that increased dislocation density in rapidly solidified AM components is responsible for higher hardness (strength) in as built condition [44,45].
Aging curves for both materials are reported in Fig. 6. In 18Ni300 alloy (Fig. 6a), by ageing at 460 °C, a progressive increase in hardness is witnessed, it appears that hardness does not show a drop within the maximum ageing time, suggesting that at this temperature the kinetics of precipitate coarsening or austenite reversion is still low. The maximum hardness of ∼600 HV1 was achieved at the longest time designated in this study (i.e., 10 h). At 490 °C, a peak hardness of 590 HV1 was achieved by 3 h holding, after this point, the hardness was almost steady although with a negligible evident drop. At the highest temperature levels (525 °C and 600 °C) the peak ageing was achieved at shorter times (i.e., 1 h and 0.5 h, respectively). At these temperatures, hardness dropped more rapidly by prolonging the ageing due to over-aging, and enhanced diffusion-controlled austenite reversion. For the Co–Ti free alloy (Fig. 6b), at the same ageing temperatures, the ageing time to reach peaks-hardness was delayed compared with 18Ni300 in agreement with lower precipitation kinetics observed by DSC analysis. For instance, at 490 °C, the hardness keeps its increasing trend even after 10 h of ageing, and at 525 °C a peak age hardness of 525 HV was achieved after 3 h (i.e., 2 h longer than that of 18Ni300). These results agree with the work of Magnee et al. [46] whereby removing Co from 18Ni300 chemistry led to a more sluggish precipitation kinetics, as well as lower peak-aged hardness compared with the Co containing counterpart (Fig. 6c). At higher ageing temperature of 600 °C, the aging kinetics seem to become similar for both alloys due to the enhanced diffusional reactions. The highest hardness value (525 HV), considering the ageing conditions in this study, was achieved after 3 h aging at 525 °C.

[46]$figure#fig6 img@https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2238785424006173-gr6_lrg.jpg}}

Based on the hardness test results, further analyses on mechanical behavior were focused on samples aged at 490 °C for 3 h (underaged), 525 °C, 3 h (peak aged), and 600 °C, 3 h (over-aged) for the Co–Ti free alloy. For the 18Ni300 maraging steel, the selected temperatures and times were 460 °C for 1 h and 490 °C for 6 h, and 600 °C, 3 h respectively.
3.2.4. Microstructural characterization after age hardening
According to EBSD band contrast (BC), and inverse pole figure (IPF) maps, in solution annealed and aged specimens, the microstructure is characterized by a lath martensite structure where lath martensite shows the martensite packet and block hierarchy in both alloys (Fig. 7 a, b, and d, e). The microstructures are comparable to the microstructure of conventionally fabricated maraging steel [10].
{{Fig. 7.

The phase maps overlaid on BC images show that the volume fraction of austenite (retained and reverted austenite) is extremely low (i.e., <0.08%) for both alloys, confirming that the ageing scenario to achieve peak hardness excludes excessive austenite reversion responsible for softening of the material (Fig. 7c and f).
3.2.5. Tensile tests
Tensile tests at room temperature were performed on samples aged at different times and temperatures. Tensile curves for both materials are reported in Fig. 8. Table 4 summarizes the main average data collected.
{{Fig. 8. Stress vs. strain records of a) 18Ni300 and b) Co–Ti free samples collected at different aging temperatures$figure#fig8 img@https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2238785424006173-gr8_lrg.jpg}}
{{Tensile properties as a function of aging temper$div#tbl4 table@table_4.txt}}


The results are in good agreement with the results of the hardness tests (see Fig. 6). Both alloys showed the highest YS and UTS at their peaks-strength (490 °C/6 h for 18Ni300 and 525 °C/3 h for Co-free steel). The highest YS and UTS values of the Co–Ti free alloy are lower than those of the 18Ni300; however, the elongation at fracture is higher (i.e., 6.8% vs. 3.8%).
In underaged condition, 18Ni300 showed a yield strength of 1400 MPa comparable to that of Co–Ti free material in underaged state (i.e., 490C, 3 h). The UTS and elongations were essentially similar.
In the over-aging condition (600 °C/3 h), UTS (1456 MPa, and 1342 MPa for 18Ni300, and Co–Ti free alloy, respectively) and YS drastically decreased for both compositions, accompanied by a significant increase in ductility (ε (%) ∼11). This phenomenon can be related to the formation of reverted austenite, and precipitate coarsening leading to a drastic decrease of Orowan strengthening contribution [47,48]. XRD patterns in Fig. 9 show the presence of the γ-austenite peaks. This confirms that at aging temperatures higher than 600 °C, reversion of martensite into austenite occurs, leading to a decrease in hardness and strength of the material [49]. Moreover, the amount of reverted austenite seems to be lower in Co–Ti free alloy compared with that of 18Ni300, another confirmation on the DSC results (Fig. 5) manifesting the more sluggish reversion kinetics in this alloy due to the lower Ni content.
{{Fig. 9. XRD patterns of 18Ni300 and Co–Ti free alloy in over-aged condition$figure#fig9 img@https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2238785424006173-gr9_lrg.jpg}}

The fracture surfaces of the two alloys in peak-aged and over-aged conditions are shown in Fig. 10. The analysis reveals the presence of dimples in the case of 18Ni300 steel in the over-aged condition and Co–Ti free alloy in both conditions. Dimples indicate micro-void coalescence and deformation by slip and are typical features of ductile failure. Dissimilarly, the fracture surface of the 18Ni300 in peak-aged condition shows the presence of cleavage facets that alternates to areas characterized by dimples. The generally higher elongation of Co–Ti free alloy is mostly attributed to its lower strength, and additionally can be a consequence of the enhanced cleanliness compared with 18Ni300.

3.2.6. Charpy impact tests
Charpy impact tests were performed to evaluate the effects of the aging and solution annealing on the toughness; the results are reported in Table 5. For both alloys, the aging conditions that led to peak-hardness were associated with the lowest energy absorbed. A significant decrease in impact toughness with aging heat treatments is generally observed in maraging steels due to the formation of intermetallic phases, and dramatic hardness increase [8,50,51]. However, the two alloys show higher Charpy impact toughness values in the over-aged condition (600 °C/3 h). The CVN data support the widely accepted fact that most engineering materials within a given microstructural class show higher toughness with a decrease in strength [52]. This is also in accordance with the work of Xavier et al. [53] where the effects of over-aging on the mechanical properties of a 18Ni300 maraging steel were studied, showing that softening accompanied by a certain amount of reverted austenite can be beneficial for the toughness of the material.
{{Energy absorbed as a function of aging temper$div#tbl5 table@table_5.txt}}


In general, the toughness of the Co–Ti free steels is lower than that of 18Ni300, due to the lower Ni contents. In the absence of Co, high Ni content impedes a fully martensitic microstructure, therefore its wt.% is normally reduced to tune the Martensite transformation temperatures. Moreover, it is reported that increase in Si + Mn content in maraging steels generally reduces notch toughness and impact energy [54,55]. Therefore, the most probable reason is the presence of higher amount of Si, and Mn in Co–Ti free material.
The current mechanical properties, especially in view of tensile strength and hardness, are in line with other Co free alternatives processed by PBF-LB. In a Co free, Ti (1 wt%) containing stainless maraging steel, Brytan et al. [56] reported a hardness of ∼52 HRC, and a tensile strength of ∼1600 MPa by ageing at 500 °C for 6 h. Another example is AM Corrax, a stainless Al (1.6 wt%) containing maraging steel, showing ∼1600 MPa tensile strength, by 4 h of ageing at 525 °C, in both AM, and wrought condition [57]. In view of the absence of Ti, and minor additions of Al, the current alloy may offer improved polishability and cleanliness, while the two mentioned alternatives offer a much better corrosion resistance.
