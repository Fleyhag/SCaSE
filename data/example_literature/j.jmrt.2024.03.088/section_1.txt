2. Materials and methods
2.1. Powder chemical composition
The starting powders chemical compositions are listed in Table 1. The Co, and Ti free (herein after Co–Ti free) contains lower Ni than that of 18Ni300, to guarantee a reasonably high martensite start temperature (Ms) in the absence of Co [25]. The absence of Co and lower Ni, leading to increased solubility of Mo in the martensitic matrix and more sluggish precipitation of Ni3Mo, is partially compensated by increased Mo content to ensure sufficient age hardening effect [25]. Al levels are kept below 0.10 wt% and are only used as a deoxidizing agent in the melt. Concerning the particle size distribution, both feedstock powders had a D10 of to 15 μm and a D90 of 53 μm. The particles size distribution measurements were performed by laser diffraction analysis according to ISO 13320.

2.2. Thermo-Calc simulations
The Thermo-Calc software [26] with the TCFE12 database was used to calculate the equilibrium step diagrams for the two alloys. In the calculations a molar amount of 1, and a pressure of 106 Pa, was selected. Scheil-Gulliver simulations were performed to understand the far from equilibrium rapid solidification behavior of the alloys. The start temperature was set to 2000 °C, and the temperature step of 1 K was used. Scheil calculations were run using the solute trapping option (TCFE12-MOBFE6) developed for the laser-based AM processes, by setting a laser scan speed of 950 mm/s and the angle between solid/liquid interface and scanning direction (α) was set as default value in the software (i.e., 45 deg) as the primary purpose of the calculations in this paper was to have a semi-quantitative comparison of the rapid solidification behavior of the two alloys [27]. Solute trapping model is based under the assumption that only the primary solid phase is the dendrite forming phase, in which, solute trapping is induced by rapid solidification. Therefore, the amount of other solid phases is affected by the solute trapping and solidification speed. Additionally, the martensite fractions vs. temperature, were calculated using the property module in Thermo-Calc software. In all conditions, based on the equilibrium step diagram results, a solution annealing temperature of 1000 °C, with a prior austenite grain size of 50 μm, was selected for the calculation of martensite fractions upon cooling.
2.3. Processing
Test cubes (15 × 15 × 15 mm3) and samples for mechanical characterizations were fabricated using an EOS M290 LPBF machine equipped with 400 W Yb-fiber laser. For the process optimization trials, the volumetric laser energy density (VED) was considered (Eq. (1)).(1)VED(Jmm3)=Pv.h.t<math><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">V</mi><mi is="true">E</mi><mi is="true">D</mi><mrow is="true"><mo stretchy="true" is="true">(</mo><mfrac is="true"><mi is="true">J</mi><msup is="true"><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">m</mi><mi is="true">m</mi></mrow><mn is="true">3</mn></msup></mfrac><mo stretchy="true" is="true">)</mo></mrow><mo linebreak="badbreak" is="true">=</mo><mfrac is="true"><mi is="true">P</mi><mrow is="true"><mi is="true">v</mi><mo is="true">.</mo><mi is="true">h</mi><mo is="true">.</mo><mi is="true">t</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>where P (W) is the laser power, v (mm/s) being laser scanning speed, h is the hatch spacing in mm, and t is the layer thickness in mm.
Hatch spacing (0.110 mm) and layer thickness (0.040 mm) were kept unchanged, while twelve different combinations of laser power (from 245 W to 365 W), and laser speed (750 mm/s to 1117 mm/s) resulting in a VED range of ∼62–∼86 J/mm3 were examined to achieve parts with >99.9 % relative density. Relative density was measured using light optical microscope (LOM) micrographs on ground (up to 1200 grit) and polished (3, and 1 μm cloth) metallographic cross-sections. The optimized parameters reported in Table 2 were used to print the two alloys (see Table 3).

The samples were then solution annealed (1000 °C, 2 h) in a furnace with a controlled Ar atmosphere, followed by air cooling. Then samples were aged for different times at 460 °C, 490 °C, 525 °C, and 600 °C, to construct the aging curves (hardness vs. time). All machining operations to obtain specimens for mechanical testing were carried out after the age-hardening heat treatment.
2.4. Mechanical testing
Vickers microhardness tests (kgf/mm2) were performed using a Future-Tech FM-810 system. The samples were subjected to a load of 1 kg for dwell time of 10 s (i.e., HV1). Vickers hardness measurements were carried out on carefully ground and polished metallographic cross-sections according to the ASTM E92-82 standard [28]. Six measurements were performed for each condition.
Tensile tests were performed using an MTS-Alliance RT/100 universal testing machine. The specimens have a gauge length of 24 mm and a diameter of 4 mm. Three tensile specimens for each of the selected conditions were tested at room temperature.
Charpy V notch (CVN) impact toughness tests were performed according to ASTM E23-23a [29]. The size of the standard specimen is 10 × 10 × 55 mm. Three specimens for each of the selected conditions were tested at room temperature.
2.5. Material characterization
Diffraction patterns were collected using a Rigaku SmartLab X-Ray diffractometer (XRD) employing Cu Kα radiation. The data were obtained in the diffraction angle range of 40°≤2θ ≤ 80°, with a step width of 0.01° and a velocity of 1°/min. Differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) tests were performed using a Labsys Setaram calorimeter. Heating ramps (10 °C/min) programmed to isochronally heat the samples up to 1200 °C.
The analysis of microstructure was performed by LOM, and a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) (Zeiss Sigma 500), equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Samples for metallography were prepared following common grinding and polishing procedures, Chemical etching was performed by Nital 2% or Kalling's reagent to reveal the microstructural features. Electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was conducted using a Symmetry EBSD detector on FE-SEM on ground and polished cross-sections. A 20 kV accelerating voltage with a working distance of 15 mm was used for the EBSD analysis.
