4. Concluding remarks
In this paper, the mechanical properties and the microstructural features of a novel Co–Ti free maraging steel, through the more cost-efficient IGA atomization route, for additive manufacturing were investigated. This alloy, which does not contain Co, Ti, and Al as alloying elements shows the potential to accelerate the transition to more sustainable and cost-effective production based on the following conclusions.•The results confirmed the feasibility of achieving a nearly fully martensitic microstructure in as built (i.e., less than 3 vol% RA) and solution annealed (i.e., fully martensitic) conditions.

•After suitable aging, the novel alloy's maximum hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength were ∼525 HV, 1475 MPa, and ∼1600 MPa, respectively. The alloy has an elongation at break of 6.4% at this strength level, showing the possibility of obtaining ultrahigh strength levels with promising ductility.

•When compared to commercially available 18Ni300 maraging steels, DSC analysis revealed a delay in austenite reversion for the Co–Ti free alloy. Hardness curves confirmed lower softening kinetics at 525 °C. The improved softening resistance at elevated temperatures is promising in light of the novel alloy's applicability in tooling.

•Impact toughness showed a slight drop in Co–Ti free alloy compared with that of 18Ni300.

•With ultrahigh strength (∼1600 MPa), and acceptable ductility (∼6%), the Co, Ti, and Al free alloy has the potential to replace 18Ni300 in most of its intended uses.
