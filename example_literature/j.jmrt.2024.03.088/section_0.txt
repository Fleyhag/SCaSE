1. Introduction
Maraging steels are age-hardening high-strength steels with very low carbon content. The high strength levels can be achieved by optimizing the chemical composition, and selection of the right sequence of heat treatments, reducing phenomena such as the reversion of martensite into austenite, the coarsening of the microstructure, and the precipitation of unwanted phases [1]. The presence of substitutional alloying elements such as Mo, Ti, and Al causes age-hardening in Fe–Ni martensite by precipitation of nano-sized intermetallic particles (e.g., Ni3Ti, Ni3Mo, NiAl, Fe7Mo6, and Laves phase) [[2], [3], [4]].
Due to their good combination of mechanical properties and weldability, maraging steels are widely commercialized in laser based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, such as Powder Bed Fusion – Laser Beam (PBF-LB) technology [5,6]. Crack free and fully dense parts with complex geometries and enhanced mechanical properties can be readily produced. Their applications vary from mold and die making industry to high-performance parts, e.g., in the aerospace industry [[7], [8], [9], [10]].
In AM, the most widely used maraging steel is 18Ni300 where the main alloying elements are nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and titanium. This alloy shows excellent strength and toughness, with the main strengthening mechanisms being precipitation hardening of Fe–Ni martensite, and solid solution hardening [[11], [12], [13], [14]]. In this alloy system, Co lowers the solubility of Mo and Ti, leading to enhanced precipitation kinetics of intermetallic phases such as nano-sized Ni3Ti, and Ni3Mo. Co, up to ∼10 wt%, also raises the martensite start (Ms) temperature, enabling the addition of higher amounts of substitutional alloying elements without leading to the formation of residual austenite [15,16]. However, cobalt remains a challenging element in 18Ni300 maraging steel, because of its high cost and more importantly its toxicity, leading to serious environmental and social issue [17,18].
In recent years, several efforts have been made to develop novel cobalt-free maraging steels [[19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. In cobalt free maraging steels, titanium and aluminum concentrations are increased since they are responsible for the formation of strengthening precipitates during aging treatments [24]. However, increasing the amount of titanium can lead to the formation of grain boundary titanium carbonitrides, causing anisotropy of the plasticity and reducing ductility. The increase in aluminum concentration is responsible for limited hardening of martensite and lowers ductility both before and after aging [16,19]. Ti and Al are also very prone to form oxides during gas atomization translating into inclusions in the printed material. Because of these reasons, the processing of such powders is mostly realized by expensive atomization routes such as Vacuum Inert Gas Atomization (VIGA) to ensure minimal loss of Ti, and Al during the atomization, avoiding nitrogen pick-up which eventually forms TiN inclusions, and achieving very low oxygen contents in the final product. Therefore, developing Co, and Ti free maraging steel powders enabling the use of the more cost-efficient routes such as Inert Gas Atomization (IGA) is of both technological and industrial interest.
In the current work, an ultrahigh strength Co, and Ti free maraging steel developed by Sandvik Osprey (Neath, UK) using inert gas atomization was fabricated by PBF-LB. The microstructure, hardness, and mechanical properties were studied before and after ageing heat treatments. Based on the thermal analysis results, and mechanical properties, an optimized ageing scenario was proposed. The results were then compared to commercial 18Ni300, fabricated and tested using the same testing conditions.
